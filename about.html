            <p class="para">I love coding, the challenge that each problem brings with it excites me.
                I use Java as main coding language,
                I am learning C at my college,
                I love self learning, and acquiring different skills, as I am new to the field of technology, I do not have any projects of my own,
                but they are for sure coming soon. I am very active on social media platforms, as I like interacting with people from various fields
                and places.
                Also , I am a die hard hiphop fan, I put my music on youtube as well.
                I also am an occasional Vlogger, and I put my vlogging videos also on youtube. I edit my vlogs myself so I am a bit of video editor myself.
                I am exploring different fields right now, currently I am exploring ethical hacking a little.
